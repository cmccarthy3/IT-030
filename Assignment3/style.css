/* Example for body
   (this might demonstrate inheritance if your <p> or <h1>
   doesn't override these styles)
*/
body {
    /* TODO: Choose a color or font family from Chapter 5 examples,
    explain in a comment why you picked it. */
    color: black; /* Easy readbility */
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; /* Common font that I usually use */
    background-color: lightgray; /* Simple color which is appealling to the eye
}

/* Example: style your <h1> externally here */
h1 {
    color: purple;
    /* TODO: pick a color or text-related property
    that might compete with your inline or internal CSS. */
}

/*
    Add more rules if desired:
    - Paragraphs (p)
    - Footer
    - etc.
  */
p {
    font-size: 18px;
}

footer {
    background-color: cornsilk;
    text-align: left;
}

/*
For demonstration:
    - Show which rules get overridden by your internal <style> block
    - Which might get overridden by inline styles
    - Comment your observations about the cascade and inheritance
*/

/*
    - Inline CSS has the highest priority which is the <h1> with the 
    color: blue;, this overrides the external h1 { color: purple; }.

    - Internal CSS has the middle priority which is the footer styles 
    in the <style> in the head and this overrides the external footer styles.

    - External CSS has the lowest priority which has all the styles in the 
    style.css file, these are the general styles for the tags unless overriden.

    - Inheritance takes place when the external styles as in this style sheet 
    get applied to tags in whatever section you applied them to and in my case 
    I applied them to the body section, so the tags within the body automatically 
    get the font-family and color applied unless overriden.
