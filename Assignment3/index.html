    Add an internal <style> block here with at least one rule.

    Refer to Chapter 5's section on using the <style> element.

    <!-- TODO #3 (Inline CSS):
    Add a style attribute to at least one element, e.g. this <h1>.
    Example: <h1 style="color: blue; font-family: serif;">My Demo</h1>
    Then explain in a comment which Chapter 5 property/properties are used
    and how they might override the external or internal CSS if conflicts arise.

    Inline styles have the highest specificity/control so this will 
    override the external and internal styles.

    <h1 style="color: blue; font-family: sans-serif;">Welcome to My Chapter 5 Demo</h1>

    <p><u>
        This paragraph should demonstrate <strong>inheritance</strong>.
        If you set a 'color' or 'font-family' on the body tag or a parent element,
        it should automatically apply here, unless it's overridden.
    </u></p>
    <p><u>
        Modify colors, fonts, text size, etc. in your external or internal CSS.
        Observe how the CSS cascade and inheritance affect these paragraphs
        vs. any inline-styled elements.
    </u></p>

    <!--
    TODO #4 (Demonstrate Cascade):
    For example, if your external CSS sets a color on <h1>,
    and your internal CSS sets a different color, see which one wins.
    Add a short comment explaining the result according to Chapter 5
    on the CSS cascade.

    This footer has both external and internal styles applied to it, 
    but since the internal CSS style comes after the external style 
    it will override it. However, if an inline style was applied to 
    the footer then the inline style would override both the external 
    and internal styles.

    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2025 My Demo Site</p>
    </footer>
</body>

<!--
- Inline CSS has the highest priority which is the <h1> with the 
color: blue;, this overrides the external h1 { color: purple; }.

- Internal CSS has the middle priority which is the footer styles 
in the <style> in the head and this overrides the external footer styles.

- External CSS has the lowest priority which has all the styles in the 
style.css file, these are the general styles for the tags unless overriden.

- Inheritance takes place when the external styles as in this style sheet 
get applied to tags in whatever section you applied them to and in my case 
I applied them to the body section, so since <color> and <font-family> are 
inheritable properties all text in <body> automatically inherits the <color>
and <font-family> that is in this external style.css.
